# README
I started making these templates to help me make the OSCP and CPTS exams easier. 
These may also be useful for Pentests and Wargames.


## How-to for Obsidian N00bs
1. git clone 
```
git clone https://github.com/Pho3nix-Jacki3/pentesting_templates_obsidian.git
```
 
 2. Open `pentesting_templates_obsidian` in your file manager
 3.  Rename the folder to whatever you want your Obsidian vault to be
 4. Delete the `.git` folder incase you want to use git to backup your Obsidian Vault
 5. Open your folder as a vault in Obsidian

6. Trust the author and enable plugins. You just need this so the community plugins work.

    **What community plugins are installed?**
     - [Templator](https://silentvoid13.github.io/Templater/ ): This is why templating is easy...Check out their documentation. 
     - [Custom File Explorer Sorting](https://github.com/SebastianMC/obsidian-custom-sort): This makes sorting files easy
     - [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) This is just an optional feature for the CyberGlow theme
    
7. Make your templates
