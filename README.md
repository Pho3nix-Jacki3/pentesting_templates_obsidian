# README
I started creating Obsidian templates to facilitate my preparation for the OSCP and CPTS exams. 
These may also be useful for Pentests and Wargames.

## How-to
1. Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/blue-pho3nix/pentesting_templates_obsidian.git
```
 2. Open `pentesting_templates_obsidian` in your file manager
 3.  Rename the folder to whatever you want your Obsidian vault called
 4. Open your folder as a vault in Obsidian

5. Trust the author and enable plugins. You just need this so the community plugins work.

    **What community plugins are installed?**
     - [Templator](https://silentvoid13.github.io/Templater/ ): This is why templating is easy...Check out their documentation. 
     - [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) This is just an optional feature for the CyberGlow theme
    
6. Learn [Templator](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater) and start creating your own templates.
7. Create an issue if you have any questions. I'll try to answer ASAP. :)
8. Remember to check back periodically for new templates. You can copy them into your vault's template folder.

## Example of use:

- `ALT` + `E` on Windows opens the template search bar
